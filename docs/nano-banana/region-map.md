**Nano Banana 3 Prompt — Region Map View (Strict "Screen Only" UI Mockup)**

Render a **flat 2D UI screenshot** of the Region Map view.  
Do **NOT** include computers, desks, hands, controllers, or physical instruments.

### Layout:

- Full-width horizontal timeline bar.
- Divide it into distinct colored blocks for each Arrangement Region:
  - Intro
  - Build
  - High-Energy / Drop
  - Breakdown
  - Outro
- Each block shows:
  - Region Name
  - Start–End time (e.g., "0:00–0:14")

### Additional Elements:

- A thin, subtle **energy curve** beneath the blocks.
- Minimal top header: "Reference Region Map."
- Bar markers along the timeline (small ticks every bar or measure).

### Visual Style:

- 2D only, flat.
- Region color suggestions:
  - Intro = soft blue  
  - Build = yellow-gold  
  - High-Energy/Drop = saturated red or hot pink  
  - Breakdown = teal or muted green  
  - Outro = soft gray or lavender

### STRICT RULES:

- Do not render:
  - Laptops  
  - Desks  
  - Keyboards  
  - Audio gear  
  - Rooms  
  - People  
- Only render the UI panels as if they were captured from inside a design system.
