**Nano Banana 3 Prompt — Ingest View (Strict "Screen Only" UI Mockup)**

Render a **2D flat UI screen only**.  
Do **NOT** show any physical computer, desk, keyboard, mouse, room, hands, cables, or 3D objects.

Create a clean UI mockup for the **Reference Ingest View** of the Song Structure Replicator.

### Requirements:

- Perspective: **front-facing, flat UI screenshot style**.
- No 3D elements, no shadows, no hardware.

### Layout:

- Main content is a **rectangular UI panel** representing the application window.
- At the top: a simple header titled **"Reference Ingest"**.
- Below header: a **grid of five drop zones**, each a bordered rectangle labeled:
  - Drums  
  - Bass  
  - Vocals  
  - Instruments  
  - Full Mix  
- Each drop zone shows:
  - A file icon placeholder
  - The stem name
  - A hint text: "Drag & Drop or Click to Upload"

### Right-Side Panel:

- A vertical info panel showing:
  - Detected BPM (editable field)
  - Detected key (optional placeholder)
  - File metadata (duration, sample rate)
  - A progress indicator when analyzing

### States to render visually:

1. **Empty State** — all drop zones blank.
2. **Files Loaded State** — simple waveform thumbnails OR colored blocks inside drop zones.
3. **Analyzing State** — progress bar across the right panel.

### Color Style:

- Flat modern DAW-inspired colors:
  - Drums = orange
  - Bass = blue
  - Vocals = purple
  - Instruments = green
  - Full Mix = neutral gray/white

### STRICT VISUAL RULES:

- Only show the UI panel.
- No environment.
- No keyboard.
- No physical devices.
- No angled perspective — straight-on 2D.
