Do Not Change Code! 

Prepare this branch for a PR to main. Add any changed files and create a commit of this milestone with a detailed summary of all of the changes implemented. Before you do, create a document in the folder '1.Documentation/MilestoneNotes' following the same naming convention <Milestone_#_MilestoneName> or follow the formatting of the existing files in that folder. 

The contents of the new file should be the summary generated by Cursor for all the prompts run in the current branch. 

Push the code to the branch once markdown file have been generated.
